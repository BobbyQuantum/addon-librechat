# LibreChat

## Configuration

On first run, the default librechat .env file will be copied to the addon_config/librechat folder.

Edit and restart to customise according to the librechat docs.

If you want to use a librechat yaml, place that into the addon_config/librechat folder and ensure you have the following in your .env file:

```
CONFIG_PATH="/config/librechat.yaml"
```
